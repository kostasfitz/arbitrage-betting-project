# arbitrageBettingProject
This project demonstrates the concept of arbitrage betting.
The two webscrapers of this repository gather the betting odds offered by each betting company. The data are stored in a csv file. 
The user should manually import the data in the according sheet of the arbitrageCalculator.xlsx for each betting company.
Automatically the arbitrage percentage and the expected profits are calculated based on the best odds provided for each event.
